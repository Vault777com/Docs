# Economics

Vault777 is a fully on-chain, non-custodial casino where all bets, outcomes, and fees are executed transparently on-chain. Every aspect of the ecosystem—from betting to liquidity provision—is designed to ensure fairness, decentralization, and sustainable incentives for players, liquidity providers, and developers.

## Gameplay & Betting

Every bet placed on Vault777 carries a 2% fee, distributed as follows:

- **1%** → Treasury
- **1%** → Minted back to players in DAO tokens

This effectively creates a 1% net house edge, as players receive DAO tokens that offset half of the fee. All bets and outcomes are powered by Chainlink VRF 2.5, ensuring verifiable randomness and provable fairness.

## Liquidity Providers (The House)

Vault777 allows anyone to act as the casino by supplying liquidity to the bankroll.

### Key Parameters

- **Deposit Fee:** 0%
- **Withdrawal Fee:** 2%
  - 1% → Treasury
  - 1% → Minted as DAO tokens to LPs

Rewards are distributed monthly through epochs, with a 3-day claim window. Unclaimed rewards are automatically restaked into the DAO.

### Exit Rules

- **Standard Exit:** Once per weekly epoch
- **Emergency Exit:** Anytime, with a dynamic penalty:
  - Base penalty: 3%
  - +1% per additional 10% of pool liquidity withdrawn
  - Maximum Cap: 30%

These rules protect liquidity depth and prevent large withdrawals from destabilizing the bankroll.

## DAO Token

The DAO token powers Vault777's ecosystem and governance model. It is distributed to users who play, stake, or provide liquidity.

### Distribution Sources

- Betting rewards (1% of every bet)
- LP withdrawal rewards (1% of withdrawal fee)
- Staking rewards
- Developer creative fees (for user-built games)

### Utility

- **Governance:** 1 token = 1 vote
- **Staking:** Earn a share of platform revenue
- **Fee Discounts:** DAO may enable fee reductions for stakers
- **Treasury Control:** DAO decides how fees and penalties are used

## Staking

Users can stake DAO tokens to earn a share of platform-generated revenue.

- **Rewards:** Distributed monthly (epoch-based)
- **Claim Window:** 3 days before auto-compounding into staking
- **Early Unstaking Penalty:**
  - 33.3% of the staked amount
  - Penalties go directly to the DAO Treasury

This model encourages long-term participation and compounds rewards over time.

## Developer Incentives

Vault777 introduces creator-driven gaming — developers can build their own games and deploy them on the platform.

- Developers earn **5%** of all fees generated by their game
- Approved games become part of the official Vault777 ecosystem
- This creates an open-market structure similar to Roblox for on-chain casinos, rewarding creativity and innovation

## Points System

Vault777 includes a Points & Leaderboard System to reward consistent engagement.

### Points Formula

Players earn points from every bet. If 2% of a bet is taken in fees, 1% (based on a $100M FDV model) is returned to the player as points.

Points are used for competitions, rankings, and rewards, aligning in-game activity with real economic value.

## Leaderboards & Competitions

During the testnet and beyond, Vault777 will feature multiple leaderboards to encourage competition:

- **Gross Profit Leaderboard:** Highest overall winnings
- **Total Points Leaderboard:** Most active participants

Additional categories such as "Most Games Played" or "Highest Volume" will rotate seasonally. Top performers will earn token rewards, early governance access, or exclusive benefits decided by the DAO.

## Revenue Distribution

Vault777's revenue streams and distribution model ensure sustainability and community ownership.

### Revenue Sources

- **2% betting fee**
  - 1% to Treasury
  - 1% to player token rewards
- **2% LP withdrawal fee**
  - 1% to Treasury
  - 1% to LP token rewards
- **Early unstaking penalties** (33.3%) → Treasury
- **Developer fees** (5%) → Shared between devs & Treasury

### Treasury Utilization

The DAO Treasury manages all collected fees and penalties. Funds can be used for:

- Buybacks & burns
- Liquidity incentives
- Audit and marketing budgets
- Community grants & development rewards

All spending decisions will be determined through DAO governance.

## Governance

Governance will activate gradually as the protocol matures.

### Phase 1: Team-Controlled

- Initial launch and liquidity setup
- Parameters controlled by the core team for stability

### Phase 2: DAO Rollout

- Governance token live
- Community proposals and voting begin
- Treasury and system parameters move under DAO control

Over time, Vault777 will evolve into a fully decentralized casino protocol governed entirely by its players, stakers, and liquidity providers.

## Design Philosophy

Vault777 is built around four fundamental principles:

1. **Provably Fair:** Every game outcome verified on-chain via Chainlink VRF 2.5
2. **Non-Custodial:** Users always retain full control over their funds
3. **Transparent:** All bets, payouts, and liquidity flows are public and auditable
4. **Player-Owned:** Activity turns into ownership through DAO token rewards

Vault777 transforms the traditional casino model into a community-driven, fully decentralized ecosystem, where everyone—from players to developers—shares in the success of the platform.

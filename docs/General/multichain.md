# Multi-Chain Integration

## Introduction

Vault777 is a **multi-chain decentralized casino**, allowing users to place bets across multiple blockchain networks. This ensures lower transaction fees, faster confirmations, and broader accessibility while maintaining full decentralization and transparency.

---

## Supported Blockchains

Vault777 supports a range of EVM-compatible chains with more to come via DAO governance:

### ✅ Live Chains

- **Ethereum (Mainnet)** – High security, used for large-value bets and reputation.
- **Arbitrum** – Ultra-low fees and fast confirmation times with Ethereum-level security.
- **zkSync Era** – ZK rollup with cheap transactions and fast finality.
- **Starknet** – ZK-based L2 designed for scale and advanced computation.
- **BNB Smart Chain (BSC)** – Popular chain with high throughput and low gas costs.

### 🧪 Planned / Community-Driven Chains

- Polygon (MATIC)
- Avalanche (AVAX)
- Scroll / Base
- Non-EVM chains (subject to compatibility research)

## Why Multi-Chain?

Vault777’s multi-chain architecture offers:

- 💸 **Lower Fees** – Choose a chain with the most favorable gas costs.
- ⚡ **Faster Gameplay** – Sub-second confirmations on L2s and BSC.
- 🌍 **Global Access** – Players on any major network can participate.
- 🔁 **Liquidity Efficiency** – Spread treasury and LP management across ecosystems.

## How Betting Works Across Chains

1. **User connects wallet** and selects preferred network.
2. **Game selection and bet placement** occur entirely on that chain.
3. **Chainlink VRF** is triggered and returns a provably fair result.
4. **Payout is returned directly** to the player’s wallet on the same chain.

---

## Example Scenario

- Alice connects her MetaMask on Arbitrum.
- She bets 100 USDC in a **Plinko** game.
- Chainlink VRF returns a 9x multiplier.
- She wins **900 USDC**, instantly credited to her wallet — no bridge, no delay.

---

## Liquidity Distribution & LP Pools

- LPs provide liquidity on-chain to support games on each network.
- DAO treasury allocates reserves dynamically based on usage.
- LP staking and rewards are **chain-specific** but trackable via cross-chain dashboards.

---

## Security Measures Across Chains

- Each chain’s contracts are independently deployed and audited.
- Chain-specific VRF subscriptions and coordinator addresses ensure VRF integrity.
- Smart contracts are immutable post-audit unless DAO-approved upgrades occur.

---

## Governance Over Expansion

Vault777 DAO will decide:

- Which chains to support next.
- When to expand existing liquidity.
- How to rebalance cross-chain reserves and fees.

---

## Conclusion

Vault777’s multi-chain architecture makes it a truly **borderless, gas-optimized, and scalable** decentralized casino. Whether you're betting on Arbitrum, zkSync, or BNB Chain, you’re playing with fairness, speed, and full transparency.

🌐 **Pick your chain. Place your bet. Win on your terms.**

# Security & Transparency

Vault777 is designed to be fully non-custodial, transparent, and provably fair. From bet placement to payout, every action is executed on-chain using immutable smart contracts and verifiable randomness. No centralized entity holds user funds, controls outcomes, or manages balances — the code does it all.

## Non-Custodial by Design

Users never deposit funds into Vault777-controlled wallets. Bets are placed directly from user wallets to the smart contract.

- No custodial risk
- No delays or manual withdrawal requests
- Funds are only temporarily held in contract during bet resolution

Winnings are paid out instantly to the user's wallet.

## Chainlink VRF for Provable Fairness

Vault777 integrates Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to generate provably fair outcomes for every game.

- Each bet triggers a request to Chainlink VRF
- The returned random number includes a cryptographic proof
- The smart contract verifies the proof on-chain before resolving the bet

This prevents any tampering, manipulation, or prediction of outcomes.

## Transparent Game Logic

All game mechanics are written in open-source smart contracts and deployed immutably on-chain.

- Anyone can verify the rules of the game
- Payouts are calculated deterministically based on inputs and outcomes
- No hidden variables or off-chain decisions

Smart contracts are accessible via block explorers and open to public audit.

## Treasury Transparency

All protocol earnings (e.g. fees, slashes, unclaimed rewards) are directed to the DAO treasury — a publicly visible wallet controlled by governance.

- Treasury balances are viewable in real-time
- Historical inflows and outflows are traceable
- DAO proposals determine how funds are used or distributed

Nothing happens behind the scenes.

## Smart Contract Security

Vault777’s core contracts are audited and follow industry best practices for DeFi protocol security.

- Read-only view functions for game state and verification
- Permissionless architecture with no admin override
- No upgradability or proxy risks unless explicitly voted on by DAO

The system is designed to minimize trust assumptions and central points of failure.

## User Privacy

Vault777 requires no sign-up or personal information.

- All interaction happens via Web3 wallets
- No emails, usernames, or identity verification
- Game history is tied only to public wallet addresses

Users retain full anonymity, backed by the transparency of the chain.

## Emergency Response

Before DAO governance is fully active, core protocol developers retain limited time-locked access to pause contracts in case of a critical bug or exploit.

Once governance is live:
- Only the DAO can vote to pause, upgrade, or reconfigure contracts
- Emergency response becomes fully decentralized and on-chain

This ensures early-phase protection with a clear path to full community control.

## Summary

Vault777 combines full on-chain execution, non-custodial architecture, Chainlink VRF, and open governance to deliver a secure, transparent, and trustless gaming experience.

- No custodians
- No black boxes
- No rigged games

Every action is on-chain. Every outcome is verifiable. Every player is in control.

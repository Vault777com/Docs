# Governance: Vault777 DAO

## Introduction

Vault777 is governed by a **decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)** powered by the $V777 token. Every major decision — from game additions to fee structure adjustments — is decided by the community through on-chain proposals and voting.

## 🗳 Governance Model

### 🧠 One Token, One Vote

- Each $V777 token equals one governance vote.
- Tokens can be **delegated** to trusted representatives.
- Both **staked** and **vested** tokens retain full voting power.

### 🧾 Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Proposal Submission**  
   Users with a minimum token threshold can create proposals via smart contract.
2. **Voting Period**  
   All token holders vote “for” or “against” within a fixed voting window (e.g. 5 days).
3. **Quorum Check**  
   A minimum vote threshold must be met for execution.
4. **Automatic Execution**  
   If passed, the proposal is executed on-chain without intermediaries.

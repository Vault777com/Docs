# Tokenomics

The Vault777 token powers the entire ecosystem. It is the foundation for governance, player rewards, liquidity incentives, and community ownership. It represents a decentralized share of the casino's success, earned by players, liquidity providers, and developers who contribute to the platform.

## Token Overview

- **Token Name:** Vault777 DAO Token
- **Symbol:** TBA
- **Type:** ERC-20
- **Chain:** Arbitrum (with multi-chain expansion planned)
- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 (1B)
- **Initial Circulation:** To be determined after mainnet launch
- **Utility:** Governance, staking, betting rewards, and liquidity incentives

## Token Utility

Vault777's token is designed to create real utility across all layers of the platform.

### 1. Governance

- 1 token equals 1 vote
- Token holders can vote on key parameters including fees, penalties, and treasury allocation
- DAO members approve new games, community grants, and reward schedules

### 2. Play-to-Earn Rewards

- Players receive DAO tokens as rebates (1% of every bet's fee)
- Active bettors accumulate ownership over time through consistent participation

### 3. Liquidity Incentives

- Liquidity providers earn DAO tokens as part of the 1% withdrawal reward
- Tokens can be staked for additional yield and governance rights

### 4. Staking Rewards

- Stakers earn a share of platform revenue from all fees, penalties, and buybacks
- Auto-compounding ensures consistent growth of staked balances

### 5. Developer Incentives

- Developers who publish games receive a share of the platform fees in tokens
- DAO may allocate further token grants to support builders and innovation

## Token Allocation (Illustrative)

### Community and Rewards – 45%
Distributed through betting, staking, and liquidity programs over time.

### Liquidity and Ecosystem – 20%
Used for liquidity bootstrapping, exchange listings, and protocol-owned liquidity.

### Team and Development – 15%
Linearly vested over 12 months, automatically staked with governance rights.

### Advisors and Partnerships – 8%
Allocated to long-term strategic contributors with vesting.

### DAO Treasury – 7%
For governance-approved initiatives such as buybacks, burns, and grants.

### Marketing and Incentives – 5%
Used for campaigns, competitions, and community growth.

**Note:** Allocations may be adjusted by DAO governance post-launch.

## Vesting and Emission

Vault777 uses a dynamic emission model that grows with the platform.

- **No pre-mint dumping:** Tokens enter circulation only through on-chain activity or vested allocations
- **Monthly distribution:** Rewards are distributed using an epoch system aligned with staking and liquidity cycles
- **Team vesting:** Team and development tokens are vested linearly over 12 months, automatically staked, and maintain governance rights
- **Withdrawal restriction:** Only unlocked tokens can be withdrawn after vesting

This structure ensures that emissions stay tied to actual protocol growth and user engagement.

## Deflationary Mechanics

Vault777 maintains long-term token value through several deflationary systems:

### 1. Buybacks and Burns
- DAO Treasury can use collected fees to repurchase and burn tokens

### 2. Early Unstaking Penalties
- **33.3%** of tokens from early unstaking are redirected to the Treasury

### 3. Burn-Based Features
- Future expansions may include optional token burns for upgrades or exclusive access

These mechanisms reduce circulating supply as platform activity increases.

## Treasury Flow

The DAO Treasury serves as the financial backbone of the protocol.

### Treasury Inflows
- **1%** of every bet
- **1%** of every LP withdrawal
- **33.3%** of all early unstaking penalties
- **50%** of developer game fees

### Treasury Usage
- Buybacks and burns
- Liquidity and exchange support
- Marketing, audits, and operations
- Community rewards and development grants

All spending decisions are determined by DAO governance once voting is live.

## Economic Sustainability

Vault777's design creates a closed, self-sustaining loop:

1. **Players bet**, generating protocol fees
2. **Fees are split** between Treasury and DAO token rewards
3. **Liquidity providers** earn returns and new tokens
4. **Developers build games** that expand revenue sources
5. **The Treasury reinvests** profits into buybacks, rewards, and growth

This ensures that the entire system remains self-reinforcing and community-owned.

## Future Expansion

The DAO token's utility will expand across:

- Cross-chain liquidity and yield integrations
- Casino hubs on BNB, zkSync, and Starknet
- Social and competitive metagame layers such as leaderboards and Vault operator systems
- DAO-managed portfolios that invest Treasury funds into yield-bearing assets

Vault777 aims to evolve into a decentralized gaming network where every participant — player, builder, and staker — benefits from the platform's long-term success.
